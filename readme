This is an implementation of a discrete perceptron for my AI class.
It's trained and tested on a Iris subsets.

Some math behind it:

weight vector is updated according to this formula:
w' = w + alpha*(d-y)*X

the devation is updated according to this formula:

theta' = theta - alpha*(d-y)

where:
w' - new weight vector
w - old weight vector
alpha - learning constant
d - expected output
y - calculated output
X - current case/observation vector
theta' - new devation
theta - old devation

inital weights and devation are chosen randomly
